# This is a list of items I use and highly recommend.

### [Nalgene Water Bottle](https://amzn.to/3cW1ZRk)
These things are literally indestructible. Have had several for years and they have survived countless falls. Also, there is no rubber so very easy and quick to clean/scrub.
I use these bottles all day, every day.

### [Bose QuietComfort 35 II Noise-Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones](https://amzn.to/3tzYXsE)
Very high-quality headphones. The noise-canceling is the highest quality I've found (I tested every model in the store).
I use them several hours a day, every day.

### [Kindle](https://amzn.to/390FN7L)
We move around a lot. We also like to read a lot. Solution: Kindle - with hundreds of books downloaded, and a single charge lasts several weeks.
I use this every day.

### [Chromebook](https://amzn.to/3c5kNP6)
Just thinking about the amount of time I wasted installing, updating and generally waiting around for Windows machines over the last 20 years makes me shudder...
Chromebooks are lightning-fast, simple and secure. With the recent addition of native Linux support, you can now do pretty much anything with them.
I use the Chromebook for ~99% of my computing use.

Note: some of these items link to Amazon which may provide me with a referral credit.
