# This is a list of items I use and highly recommend.

### [Nalgene Water Bottle](https://amzn.to/3cW1ZRk)
These things are literally indestructable. Have had several for years and they have survived countless falls. Also, there is no rubber so very easy and quick to clean/scrub.
I use these bottles all day, every day.

### [Bose QuietComfort 35 II Noise-Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones](https://amzn.to/3tzYXsE)

Very high quality headphones. The noise-cancelling is the highest quality I've found (I tested every model in the store).
I use them several hours a day.

Note: some of these items link to Amazon which may provide me with a referral credit.
